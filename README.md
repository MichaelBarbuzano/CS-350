# CS-350

This repository contains the milestone three workspace as well as the final project workspace, which were created using code compose studio.  The milestone three workspace was a project where I was instructed to create code to blink LEDs on a TI CC3220S microcontroller to display morse code messages.  The default message being displayed by the LEDs was "SOS" and after a button is pressed, the message changes to "OK" after the current message is complete.
